Timmy is having some difficulty with math. I recommend he work on studying
Abstract Algebra and Cathegory Theory. This extra practice will help him feel
more relaxed when doing math in the classroom. Please contact me if you need
materials to get him started.

Timmy has a good understanding of all other math concepts taught so far this
year. He continues to turn in excellent assignments and especially enjoys
handson math activities.
